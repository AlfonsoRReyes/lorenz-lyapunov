## Plots
The first plot is of two Lorenz sets running at a perturbation equal zero on state variables and parameters; the Lyapunov exponent will be around zero or zero. What I am trying to demonstrate is how an infinitesimal change in any of the inputs of Lorenz causes a big disturbance in its output. 

I am trying to reproduce the experiment that was published here: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7332753927601360901-Fjp2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAALDhKYB3smISZpSGggYikbgW7U86Ika1Ug.

One of the best articles I've found that scientifically proves that no "AI" or machine learning algorithm can perform reliable predictions in nonlinear chaotic systems.
